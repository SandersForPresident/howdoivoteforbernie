Thank you for stopping by.  The end game is to make it as easy for people to vote for Bernie Sanders as possible.  Given **the internet** this seems like it should be a simple task.  And it is, if we crowd source the heavy work.  Which is why we need as much of your time as you're willing to give.

We're going to try to take this task in increments, but our first project is serving "yes/no" information on whether you need to be registered.  You can find that info [here](./public/data/primary.js).


The next step is state-by-state (for those needed) organizing links, locations, steps for how to register as a Democrat.  This information will go [here](./public/data/vote.js).
