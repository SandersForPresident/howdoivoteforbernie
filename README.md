Thank you for stopping by.  The end game is to make it as easy for people to vote for Bernie Sanders as possible.  Given **the internet** this seems like it should be a simple task.  And it is, if we crowd source the heavy work.  Which is why we need as much of your time as you're willing to give.

We're going to try to take this task in increments, but our first project is below.   If you are not comfortable with json, write the below information in simple bullet form and email it to dpxxdp@gmail.com.  Better yet if you have time, make a Google Spreadsheet and start filling in data.  The data fits a relational model pretty well so that would be immensely helpful.
